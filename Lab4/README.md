# Lab 4

We will again be looking at experimental data from the CLAS detector at JLAB. Last week we just looked at the scattered electrons, this week we will look at events with both a scattered electron and a scattered pi^+. The electron information is stored in the "e_p","e_cx","e_cy" and "e_cz" banks while the pi^+ information is stored in the "pip_p","pip_cx","pip_cy" and "pip_cz" banks.

We will attempt to calculate the missing mass from the reactions which have a scattered electron and a pi^+.

## Physics Calculations

-   [ ] Write down the electron beam 4 vector.
-   [ ] Write down the proton target 4 vector.
-   [ ] Write down the scattered electron 4 vector.
-   [ ] Write down the pi^+ 4 vector.
-   [ ] Calculate the missing mass.
    -   Hint: Remember conservation of energy

## Programming

-   [ ] Look at the C macro or python programs.
-   [ ] Create a 4 vector for the Electron beam, e_mu.
-   [ ] Create a 4 vector for the Proton target, p_mu.
-   [ ] Create a 4 vector for the scattered pion, pi_mu.

## Graphs

-   [ ] TH1D for missing mass Calculations.

## Questions

-   [ ] What is the missing particle of the reaction?
