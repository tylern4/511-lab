# Lab 2

In this lab we will use data collected from the Sr90 source used in the previous lab. The number of β− decay reactions, x, occurring from our Sr90 sample within a given time interval ∆t, was collected for different time intervals T. If we look at the Poisson distribution:

* * *

![Poisson](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\large&space;P(x;r\Delta&space;t)&space;=&space;\frac{(r\Delta&space;t)&space;^&space;x}{x!}&space;e^{-r\Delta&space;t})

* * *

r is the detected-reaction rate and the mean number of events measured within the time interval is given by r∆t = m.
